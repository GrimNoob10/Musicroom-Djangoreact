REACT

 npm init -y (-y stands for yes. 
             will simply generate an empty npm project without going through an interactive process and fill the JSON with preset values. )
 
 npm i webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
 (Webpack CLI provides the interface of options webpack uses in its configuration file. The CLI options override options passed in the configuration file. The CLI provides a rich set of commands that helps you develop your application faster.)

npm i @babel/core babel-loader @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react --save-dev

npm i react react-dom --save-dev

npm install @material-ui/core

npm install @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties

npm install react-router-dom

npm install @material-ui/icons

for React make a file of babel.config.json and write the code in it

now make a file webpack.config.js and write a code in it

after making several files

We actually make a django template to render the frontend and then the frontend is managed by the react further
